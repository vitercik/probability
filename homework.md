# Homework

## Assignments
Assignments will be posted on Gradescope.

## (Tentative) homework deadlines
Homeworks will be due at 11:59pm on the following dates:
- **Thursday, April 11:** HW1 out
- **Thursday, May 2:** HW1 due, HW2 out
- **Thursday, May 16:** HW2 due, HW3 out
- **Thursday, May 30:** HW3 due

## Late submissions

Despite the best planning, we know that life happens! So:

- You are permitted 4 "late days" for your assignments. In other words, there would be no penalty if you submitted one of the assignments four days late, or two of the assignments two days late, etc.
- Beyond that, your grade for an assignment goes down by 7 points (e.g., 90% to 83%) for every 12 hours the assignment is late, up until a week after the deadline, at which point the assignment will receive a grade of 0%.
