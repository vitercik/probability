## Description

Probability is the foundation behind many important disciplines, including statistics, machine learning, risk analysis, stochastic modeling, and optimization. This course provides an in-depth undergraduate-level introduction to fundamental ideas and tools of probability. Topics include the foundations (sample spaces, random variables, probability distributions, conditioning, independence, expectation, variance), a systematic study of the most important univariate and multivariate distributions (Normal, Multivariate Normal, Binomial, Poisson, etc...), as well as a peek at some limit theorems (basic law of large numbers and central limit theorem).

## Learning goals

Through active engagement and completion of course activities, you will be able to work with randomness and uncertainty in diverse application domains by employing probabilistic reasoning. This will involve understanding:
- The random variables that are most widely used to model randomness throughout science and engineering,
- Paradoxes and common pitfalls when applying probabilistic reasoning, and
- How to update probabilistic models based on new information and experimental data.

## Course structure

This course will be facilitated through a combination of in-person class meetings with the professor and sections with CAs. All assignments will be posted on Canvas. Announcements will also be made through the Canvas site, and any questions should be posted to Ed.
- **Lecture:** Our class will meet on Mondays and Wednesdays from 1:30-2:50 PM in STLC 111.
- **Section:** Each student will be assigned to one of three hour-long weekly sections, consisting of about one third of the students. A CA will guide the students through problems related to the week's lecture and homework. Scheduling will be announced soon.
- **Homework:** You will submit your weekly homework assignments on Gradescope (linked to on Canvas). The deadline for each homework will be Thursdays at 12pm.
